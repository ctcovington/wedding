**Do you have a registry?**
We don't have a registry! We are lucky to have everything we need, and truly don't want any gifts. 
Celebrating with friends and family means more to us than anything else we could imagine, and we can't wait to do just that with you! 



**What should I wear?**
The dress code is cocktail attire-- think dresses knee-length or below, dressy separates or jumpsuits, and suits (tie optional). Feel free to add a bit of personal flair to the mix!

If you have any other questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to us at abdu.covington@gmail.com.

**Do you have a registry?**
We don't have a registry. We're lucky to have everything we need already! The best gift you can give us is celebrating alongside us— we can’t wait to see you!


**What should I wear?**
The dress code is cocktail attire: think dresses knee-length or below, dressy separates or jumpsuits, and suits (tie optional). We recommend block heels or flats for getting around the outdoor venue. And, of course, feel free to add a bit of personal flair to the mix!

If you have any other questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to us at abdu.covington@gmail.com.

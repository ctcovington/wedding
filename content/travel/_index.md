## GETTING TO ASHEVILLE

If you plan to fly, we recommend flying into Asheville Regional Airport (AVL), which is about 20 minutes from downtown Asheville. The next closest option is the Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport (GSP), which is about 1 hour and 15 minutes from Asheville.

## GETTING TO THE VENUE
For anyone staying at the Hilton Garden Inn Asheville Downtown, we will provide a shuttle service to the venue on the day of the wedding.

For those who wish to drive, we will have parking available at the venue.
The parking lot is a short walk from the ceremony and reception areas and golf carts will
be provided for anyone who needs them.
